## Summary
Software Engineer with 8+ years designing and delivering full‑stack web and mobile solutions.  I have a strong background in security‑focused development, building modular platforms that expose capabilities through portals, SDKs and CLI tools.  My experience spans automation of CI/CD pipelines, SecOps practices such as IAM, WAF and SIEM integration, and DevOps infrastructure as code using Terraform.  I lead cross‑functional teams, drive an inclusive engineering culture and continuously improve performance, reliability and scalability.
